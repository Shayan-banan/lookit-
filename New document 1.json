You may want to mention the various conditions kids were assigned to if you didn't before, and try to head off any concerns parents might have about how their child 'did' on the study, especially if there are 'correct' answers that will have been obvious to a parent. <br><br> It is great if you can link people to a layperson-accessible article on a related topic - e.g., media coverage of one of your previous studies in this research program, a talk on Youtube, a parenting resource. <br><br> If you are compensating participants, restate what the compensation is (and any conditions, and let them know when to expect their payment!
